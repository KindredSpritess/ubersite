"codenameDescription": "The highest rank of the protoss Templar Caste (the warriors of the Protoss) is <strong>Executor</strong>. Many famous protoss have held his rank, including Tassadar and Selendis. Executors are charge of whole protoss armies, and report only to the Hierarch (currently Artanis). Prior to the Zerg invasion of Aiur, Executors were sworn to protect it, using whatever resources were available to them. Due to the nature of their work, Executors have been present at major moments in StarCraft history: Executor Tassadar was the first protoss to discover the zerg and terran races on Chau Sara, and many years before Executor Adun was ordered to capture and execute the Dark Templar. Adun and Tassadar both made history; despite initially being seen as traiters, their names are now evoked by protoss across the galaxy."
